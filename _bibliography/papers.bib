  abstract = "Sentence splitting involves the segmentation of a sentence into two or more shorter sentences. It is a key component of sentence simplification, has been shown to help human comprehension and is a useful preprocessing step for NLP tasks such as summarisation and relation extraction. While several methods and datasets have been proposed for developing sentence splitting models, little attention has been paid to how sentence splitting interacts with discourse structure. In this work, we focus on cases where the input text contains a discourse connective, which we refer to as discourse-based sentence splitting. We create synthetic and organic datasets for discourse-based splitting and explore different ways of combining these datasets using different model architectures. We show that pipeline models which use discourse structure to mediate sentence splitting outperform end-to-end models in learning the various ways of expressing a discourse relation but generate text that is less grammatical; that large scale synthetic data provides a better basis for learning than smaller scale organic data; and that training on discourse-focused, rather than on general sentence splitting data provides a better basis for discourse splitting.",

abstract = {This paper investigates how automated query generation methods can be used to derive effective ad-hoc queries from verbose patient narratives. In a clinical setting, automatic query generation provides a means of retrieving information relevant to a clinician, based on a patient record, but without the need for the clinician to manually author a query. Given verbose patient narratives, we evaluated a number of query reduction methods, both generic and domain specific. Comparison was made against human generated queries, both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and characteristics of human queries. Query reduction was an effective means of generating ad-hoc queries from narratives. However, human generated queries were still significantly more effective than automatically generated queries. Further improvements were possible if parameters of the query reduction methods were set on a per-query basis and a means of predicting this was developed. Under ideal conditions, automated methods can exceed humans. Effective human queries were found to contain many novel keywords not found in the narrative. Automated reduction methods may be handicapped in that they only use terms from narrative. Future work, therefore, may be directed toward better understanding effective human queries and automated query rewriting methods that attempt to model the inference of novel terms by exploiting semantic inference processes.},
