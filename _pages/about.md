I am currently a machine learning scientist at [NuMind](https://numind.ai) where I am working on NuExtract, a family of LLMs specialized for multi-modal information extraction.

I have broad research interests including language models, evaluation, controllability/alignment, and information retrieval. I am also passionate about applications of NLP and machine learning to accessability, medicine/health-care, and other human-facing domains. 

I completed my PhD in the [SyNaLP](https://synalp.loria.fr/){:target="\_blank"} team of [LORIA](https://loria.fr/){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of [Claire Gardent](https://members.loria.fr/CGardent/){:target="\_blank"} and [JoÃ«l Legrand](http://joel-legrand.fr/hugo/){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD research was focused on controllable and document-level approaches to text simplification.

Before my PhD I was a machine learning engineer at [Notiv](http://notiv.com){:target="\_blank"} (now [Dubber](https://www.dubber.net){:target="\_blank"}) where I worked on the implementation and deployment of machine learning products for natural language and speech applications.

I completed my bachelors and honours degrees at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. My honours thesis focused on the generation of clinical search queries and was supervised by [Guido Zuccon](http://ielab.io/people/guido-zuccon.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Bevan Koopman](http://koopman.id.au/){:target="\_blank"}.
