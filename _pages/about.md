I am a first-year PhD student working in the [SyNaLP](https://synalp.loria.fr/){:target="\_blank"} team of [LORIA](https://loria.fr/){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of [Claire Gardent](https://members.loria.fr/CGardent/){:target="\_blank"} and [JoÃ«l Legrand](http://joel-legrand.fr/hugo/){:target="\_blank"}. My research is focused on the use of linguistic structure within neural text generation tasks.

Before starting my PhD I was a machine learning engineer at [Notiv](http://notiv.com){:target="\_blank"} where I worked on the implementation and deployment of machine learning products for natural language and speech applications.

I completed my bachelors and honours degrees at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. My honours thesis focused on the generation of clinical search queries and was supervised by [Guido Zuccon](http://ielab.io/people/guido-zuccon.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Bevan Koopman](http://koopman.id.au/){:target="\_blank"}.
